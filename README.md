## Project Description

The React Native SDK integrates Chimoney's API into React Native applications, enabling functionalities such as global payouts, 
payment requests, and other financial services. The SDK aims to simplify the interaction between mobile applications and 
Chimoney's backend services with a modular, extendable, and platform-agnostic design. 
The SDK is built with TypeScript to ensure type safety and reliability.

## Features

- **Global Payouts**: Facilitate seamless global payouts through the Chimoney API.
- **Payment Requests**: Create and manage payment requests between users and merchants.
- **Modular Architecture**: The SDK is divided into reusable modules for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed to work seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **TypeScript Support**: Strongly typed API with TypeScript to ensure type safety across the SDK.

## SetUp Instructions

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime to run the project locally. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
- **React Native**: A framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. [Official Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/).
- **Text Editor**: A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for an enhanced development experience.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JosephMugo8711/React-native-sdk
    ```

    ```bash
    cd React-native-sdk
    ```

2. Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
3. Build the SDK (Optional)
If you plan to modify the SDK or use it in a custom React Native project, you may want to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript for use in your environment. You can do this with:

        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```

## Technologies Used

1. **TypeScript**: Type-safe language that improves the development experience by providing static types and enhancing code quality.
2. **React Native**: A cross-platform mobile app framework used to develop the SDK, ensuring it works on both iOS and Android.
3. **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the SDK, managing dependencies, and running build scripts.
4. **npm**: Package manager for managing dependencies and running build scripts.
5. **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code. Ensures code quality and consistency across the project by enforcing coding standards and preventing potential bugs.
6. **Prettier**: A code formatter that automatically formats code according to a consistent style, reducing discussions on code formatting and ensuring readability across teams.
